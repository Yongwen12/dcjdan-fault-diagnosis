Hi!

This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of the **DCJDAN** model from our paper:

**"Deep Coupled Joint Distribution Adaptation Network: A Method for Intelligent Fault Diagnosis Between Artificial and Real Damages"**

## Research question

In real-world industrial applications, fault diagnosis models are often trained on data from artificially induced damage, which significantly differs from naturally occurring faults. This domain gap limits model performance in deployment.
This project proposes DCJDAN, a dual-stream deep adaptation network that aligns feature distributions and improves generalization from lab conditions to real conditions.


## ðŸŒŸ Highlights
- Two-stream untied CNNs to model domain-specific representations.
- Joint Distribution Adaptation (JDA) for reducing domain gaps.
- Supports diagnosis from artificial â†’ real damage domains (TIM & TDM tasks).
- Outperforms state-of-the-art models by 10%â€“40% in benchmark experiments.
